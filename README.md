## API Integration

The application uses a currency conversion API to fetch up-to-date exchange rates. The API endpoint follows a pattern where the selected currency is dynamically injected into the URL to retrieve its corresponding data.

## User Interface

The app's interface includes:
- **Input Boxes:** Two primary input sections for "From" and "To" currencies. Each section allows the user to:
    - Input the amount.
    - Select a currency type from a dropdown.
- **Swap Functionality:** A dedicated button to switch the "From" and "To" currency selections quickly.
- **Convert Button:** A submission button to trigger the conversion process once the user has provided the necessary inputs.


This app integrates external data for real-time currency exchange rates and provides an intuitive UI to facilitate the conversion process. The focus is on user experience with clear labeling, interactive controls, and a modern design.
